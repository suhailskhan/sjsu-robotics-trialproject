# SJSU Robotics Trial Project

My trial project submission for the Intelligent Systems division in the SJSU Robotics Club.

## Envrionment
Python 3.9.17</br>
Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS arm64 (also tested on macOS 13.4; functions identically)

### Note on Setup
I used `pyenv` to manage my virtual environment. If you also happen to use pyenv, you can use the following commands to quickly set up an environment to run this project:
```bash
pyenv install 3.9.17
pyenv virtualenv 3.9.17 trialproject
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Note: On macOS you may need to install `pyenv-virtualenv` with `brew install pyenv-virtualenv` before you can use the `pyenv virtualenv` command.
